    "\n",

    "### Data transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is in the form of raw text. This was fine when we were using a rule-based model, but it won't work with $k$ nearest neighbours. Instead, we'll need to transform the data into a numerical representation. One popular way to do this with text data is to compute *term frequency* (TF) and *inverse document frequency* (IDF) measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Term frequency is a measure of how often a given term appears in a given document, e.g. how often the word \"free\" appears in a given SMS message. The more often a word appears in a document, the higher its term frequency.\n",
    "- Inverse document frequency is a measure of how rare a word is in a set of documents, e.g. the word \"the\" appears commonly in many SMS messages and so its presence (or absence) provides little information when it comes to distinguishing spam from ham. The higher the inverse document frequency of a word, the rarer it is (and, therefore, the more distinguishing power it has).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, term frequency and inverse document frequency are combined as a single metric, [*term frequency-inverse document frequency*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (TF-IDF), which is simply the multiple of the individual values. Consequently, if a term has a high TF-IDF score, its presence across a set of documents (e.g. SMS messages) is low, while its number of occurrences in a given document (e.g. a candidate SMS message under evaluation) is high. If a term has a low TF-IDF score, this is an indicator that it doesn't appear very frequently in a given document, occurs very frequently across the set of documents, or both. We can exploit this information to find terms that can distinguish a certain set of documents (e.g. spam) from a larger set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dummy modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build the $k$ nearest neighbours model, let's build a dummy model, i.e. a naive model that predicts new values using a simple strategy. Dummy models are usually not good predictors (we usually won't use them to solve real problems), but are useful because they provide a baseline accuracy measurement for the data set, from which we can gauge the accuracy of any further models we build. In Lab 05, we built a rule-based model for SMS message spam detection for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scikit-learn` provides dummy model functionality via the [`dummy`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.dummy) subpackage. This subpackage provides both dummy regression and classification algorithms, which can be customised with different strategies. We can use the [`DummyClassifier`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html#sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier) class to build a dummy classification model. `DummyClassifier` supports five different strategies for predicting values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `strategy='stratified'`: Predict new values randomly, but in proportion to their frequency in the training set.\n",
    "2. `strategy='most_frequent'`: Predict new values as the most frequently occurring target variable in the training set.\n",
    "3. `strategy='prior'`: Predict new values as the most frequently occurring target variable in the training set. This is essentially the same as `strategy='most_frequent'`, but returns different values when the `predict_proba` method is called.\n",
    "4. `strategy='uniform'`: Predict new values randomly, with equal probability.\n",
    "5. `strategy='constant'`: Predict new values as some constant value (the constant value must also be specified using the `constant` keyword argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a model that predicts new values in proportion to their occurrence in the training set. As usual, we create an instance of the model building class and then use the `fit` method to fit it to the training data:"
